Installing GWpy VET
###################

.. warning::

   Currently GWpy VET is in pre-release, all features may change without warning, and nothing is actually guaranteed to work in the first place.

You can install the GWpy VET toolbox by first `installing GWpy <../../latest/install.html>`_, then installing VET with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/gwpy/vet

If you are not the system administrator, you will need to add the `--user` option to install into your home directory, and not a system-wide path.
