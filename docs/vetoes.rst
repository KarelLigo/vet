What are Vetoes?
================

Vetoes are used to excise times of known problems from analyses of laser interferometer gravitational-wave detector data, and are typically generated from studying correlations between excess noise in the gravitational-wave data readout, and auxiliary signals used to control and sense instrumental systems.
These correlations are then recorded as time segments and recorded in a database.

These veto segments are then applied to gravitational-wave searches by excising the times identified, or removing event candidates from search results.

All vetoes are defined before the gravitational-wave data are searched for potential astrophysical events, and so they present an unbiased way of cleaning bad data associated with known noise couplings.
However, only those vetoes who perform well in cleaning data with as small a loss of analysis time as possible should be used, to maximise the potential for detection.

This software suite provides methods for data analysts to test new and existing data quality vetoes on training data, to decide which to use in the full analysis.
